Login and Password:
Hash password, keep in database
Give back cookie. Store cookie. No one can query cookie database
All stuff needs cookie

Location:
Locations will just be latitude and longtitude. Hopefully some libs to
deal with sample latitude and longtitude positions. Need to read more about
location libraries.
Could always roll my own distance function

People and Events:
Events need tags to be filterd. Same as people.

Will need a user class. History and whatnot
